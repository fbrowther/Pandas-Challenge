# Pandas-Challenge

City’s school district performance data was provided for our analysis to identify any trends that might assist the school board and mayor, to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. 
In this capacity, I have analysed the district-wide standardised test results at our Data Analytics department, to determine the performance of schools based on student's math and reading scores, as well as other relevant information on the schools such as school type, school size, and schools’ annual budget. 
The significant insights that I was able to draw from the analysis (using Pandas dataframe) have been discussed in detail and presented in the form of a report in the attached file - 'School Performance Report - Autumn 2022'
